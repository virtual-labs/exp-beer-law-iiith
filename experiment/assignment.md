**Pre-Experiment**

1. If all the light passes through a solution without any absorption, then what are the values of absorbance and percent transmittance?
2. If all the light is absorbed, then what are the values of absorbance and percent transmittance?
3. If A = 2.00, then what are the % of the photons absorbed and reach the detector?
4. "The optical absorbance of a chromophore in a transparent solvent varies linearly with both the sample path length and the chromophore concentration." Is the statement true or false?
5. What is the absorbance value when the absorption cross-section of a molecule is zero?

**Post-Experiment**

1. "A dilute solution of a chromophore can absorb more light than that its concentrated solution." Justify the statement.
2. Is the absorbance vs. concentration plot linear for any concentration range of a substance?
3. Which data appears convenient to handle for quantitative analysis - absorbance data or transmittance data- and why?
4. What is the necessity of constructing more than one plot of absorbance vs. concentration for more than one wavelength?
